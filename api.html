							<h1 class="h1 mt-5" id="item-4">Requests</h1>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								Each endpoint in our API has its own unique path.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								Data is accessed and utilized via standard HTTPS requests in
								UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. Where possible, the API uses
								appropriate HTTP verbs for each action:
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>GET</b>: Retrieves resources <br />
								<b>POST</b>: Creates resources<br />
								<b>PUT</b>: Changes and/or replaces resources or collections<br />
								<b>DELETE</b>: Deletes resources
							</p>

							<h1 class="h1 mt-5" id="item-5">Responses</h1>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								Triple Play Pay API responses always include a JSON object.
								Explore the documentation in the navigation list under this tab
								for endpoints and their responses.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>Status Codes</b>: Our API uses the following response status
								codes, as defined in the RFC 2616 and RFC 6585:
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>200</b> - OK <br />

								The request has succeeded. The client can read the result of the
								request in the body and the headers of the response.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>201</b> - Created <br />
								The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource
								being created.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>202</b> - Accepted <br />
								The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing
								has not been completed.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>204</b> - No Content <br />
								The request has succeeded but returns no message body.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2"><b>304</b> - Not Modified</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>400</b> - Bad Request <br />
								The request could not be understood by the server due to
								malformed syntax. The message body will contain more
								information.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>401</b> - Unauthorized <br />
								The request requires user authentication or, if the request
								included authorization credentials, authorization has been
								refused for those credentials.403Forbidden - The server
								understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>404</b> - Not Found <br />
								The requested resource could not be found. This error can be due
								to a temporary or permanent condition.
							</p>

								Rate limiting has been applied.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">

								us by posting in the GitHub discussion.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>502</b> - Bad Gateway <br />
								The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an
								invalid response from the upstream server.
							</p>

							<p class="p1 mt-2">
								<b>503</b> - Service Unavailable <br />
								Again, you should not come across any of these. The server is
								currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary
